# Backlog campaign tracker

Protocol: restore → compute the ready/conflict graph → mark the wave Dispatched
→ dispatch (parallel workers + review) → serialize the merge →
update this tracker once more at settlement → loop until the queue is empty or
blocked → write handover.

Driven by the `backlog-handover` skill (`.claude/skills/backlog-handover/SKILL.md`). This is a
new campaign round following the prior one (see `doc-4`, now complete — waves 1-15, all of
NCOW-9/10/12/16/17/18/19 and NCOW-31 Done there). This round exists specifically because
NCOW-31's own two review passes filed five follow-up tasks (NCOW-32 through NCOW-36) that
doc-4's inventory predates.

## Confirmed at init (2026-08-04) — do not re-ask

Fresh inventory of all 10 open Backlog tasks (`backlog task list --exclude-status Done`) at
this init: NCOW-7, NCOW-11, NCOW-13, NCOW-14, NCOW-15, NCOW-32, NCOW-33, NCOW-34, NCOW-35,
NCOW-36. Classification:

- **NCOW-32 through NCOW-36 are queued.** All five are follow-ups filed directly from
  NCOW-31's review passes, each names a concrete, objectively-verifiable acceptance criteria
  set, and each depends only on NCOW-31, which is Done — none blocked.
- **NCOW-7, NCOW-11, NCOW-13, NCOW-14, NCOW-15 remain excluded, unchanged since doc-4's
  round (all last updated 2026-07-31, before this init).** Re-checked fresh rather than
  trusted from the old tracker — still correctly not agent-resolvable as filed:
  - NCOW-7: explicitly PARKED (its own implementation notes) pending NCOW-15, since NCOW-13/15
    would likely make a rebuilt wizard structure throwaway work.
  - NCOW-11: has an open, unresolved design question (where do usage metrics actually come
    from against a stock, database-free LiteLLM install) that must be answered before the
    work is even scopeable.
  - NCOW-13: depends on NCOW-14, which is itself undecomposed.
  - NCOW-14: its own description says "Expect this to want splitting into subtasks when it is
    picked up" — a deep, multi-provider abstraction, not a single agent-sized unit.
  - NCOW-15: same self-described need to split into subtasks, plus multiple undecided design
    questions (single vs. multi-proxy, client-config-on-switch behavior).
  These five need a separate planning/decomposition session before a future campaign round
  can queue them — not something this round can resolve.

## Confirmed queue order (2026-08-04) — do not re-ask

User confirmed the proposed order: docs-only and comment-only fixes first (lowest risk,
zero/near-zero behavior change), then isolated hardening, then the tray refactor (structural
but well-scoped, precedent in menu.js), then the mutex-serialization change (most
behaviorally significant, touches live uninstall/auto-update proxy-stop paths) last.

## Frontier

The "ready now" set is ALWAYS recomputed live from the Backlog task list + this table
at the start of every restore/wave — never trust a persisted "next wave" plan.
Informational hint only: as of init (2026-08-04), 5 ready (NCOW-32/33/34/35/36), 0 blocked
within this round's queue, 5 excluded pending human decomposition (see Not queued).
NCOW-33 and NCOW-32 share the `proxy-mutex` cluster and both plausibly touch
`engine-context.js` — expect them to land in different waves even though neither depends on
the other in Backlog's own Dependencies field.

## Queue (confirmed order)

| # | Task ID | Cluster | Deps (mirrors each task's real `dependencies` field) | Status | Wave | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | NCOW-34 | docs | NCOW-31 (Done) | To Do | | README/DESIGN.md doc-only update, no code |
| 2 | NCOW-33 | proxy-mutex | NCOW-31 (Done) | To Do | | Comment-only correction in engine-context.js, no behavior change |
| 3 | NCOW-36 | configgen | NCOW-31 (Done) | To Do | | Harden thrown-value logging guard against unstringifiable throws |
| 4 | NCOW-35 | tray | NCOW-31 (Done) | To Do | | Extract tray actions into a testable factory, matching menu.js precedent |
| 5 | NCOW-32 | proxy-mutex | NCOW-31 (Done) | To Do | | Serialize Uninstall + auto-update proxy-stop against the shared proxy mutex |

## Resolved

| # | Task ID | Status/date/wave | Evidence summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Not queued — needs a human / blocked

- NCOW-7: PARKED pending NCOW-15 (own implementation notes, 2026-07-31) — rebuilding the
  Setup wizard now would likely be thrown away once NCOW-13/15 land.
- NCOW-11: open design question unresolved — where usage metrics come from against a stock,
  database-free LiteLLM install is not yet established, so the work isn't scopeable yet.
- NCOW-13: depends on NCOW-14, which is itself undecomposed — not resolvable until NCOW-14 is
  split and at least partly landed.
- NCOW-14: self-described as needing decomposition into subtasks before it's agent-sized; a
  deep multi-provider abstraction, not a single unit of work.
- NCOW-15: same — self-described need to split into subtasks, plus undecided design
  questions (single vs. multi-proxy, client-config-on-switch behavior) that need a human
  product decision first.
